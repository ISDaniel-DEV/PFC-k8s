This is my final project for the grade I've been studing last 3 years. It is a deployment of kubernetes with the whole project configuration. Made to run with minikube.
It is composed of:

- Springboot Server
- NodeJS Server
- MySQL Database
- Nginx Frontend Server

The frontend is HTML, CSS and Javascript.

All deployed with Kubernetes.
